This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

fileName <- "C:/Users/Ellie Maclennan/OneDrive - Toronto Metropolitan University/Certificate - CIND820/Data/2016_CSD_Capstone/2016_CSD_Data.csv"

#importing data set
rawData <- read.csv(fileName,sep=",",
         stringsAsFactors=FALSE,na.strings = c("",NA))

#Q1) checking datatypes - says data type below
sapply(rawData, class)
head(rawData)
```


```{r}
#using names function renaming the column heading names to be something more intuitive, for now keeping other column names as they are

#renaming geographic info and identifiers
names(rawData)[1:6]<- c("GeoUID","ProvCode","ProvName","cdCode","cdName","daName")

#renaming mobility variables
names(rawData)[7:24]<- c("Non-movers_1yr"
,"Movers_1yr"
,"Movers_Non-migrants_1yr"
,"Movers_Migrants_1yr"

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
